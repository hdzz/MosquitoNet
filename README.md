## This project is still in it's infancy!
 
I'm using it and it's working well for me, but if there's something you don't like, please log an issue or reply with +1
to and existing issue.

## Features

- Exhaustive tests. You specify what values each parameter can have and your test will be run for every possible 
combination of these values.      

- Nested contexts.

- Minimal use of macros. They're are all prefixed with M_ so you know if you're in C++ land or crazy macro city.
